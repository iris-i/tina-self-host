In its intended use, it is spoken to oneself and not to another person. The intent is to warm up the tongue and develop the dexterity thereof by saying “red leather, yellow leather” repeatedly without making any mistakes. Because the R and L sounds are easily swapped by accident when speaking this helps the performer to avoid accidental slips of the tongue.

Another example of such an exercise is “she sells sea shells by the sea shore”. Most people know the phrases as tongue twisters.
